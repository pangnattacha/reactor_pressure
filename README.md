# Reactor pressure
## Introduction
This is a project to calculate pressure inside a reactor when water inside the reactor is heated and the reactor is completely closed. That is, water and air inside the reactor do not leak out. Vaporization of water takes place during the process. Therefore, the pressure indside the reactor increases over saturated pressure and liquid water is compressed . 

## Problem setting

Water is filled in 80% of total volume of reactor (V_re). The initial volume of water (V_water) is then equal to 0.8V_re. Assuming that water in air is neglegible, and thus volume of space is volume of the air (V_air). Then the reactor is closed and heated to designated temperatures of 200 degree celcius. Partially, water vaporizes into gas phase, thus volume of liquid water consequently changes. The new volumes of gas phase and water become V_a and V_b, respectively.
